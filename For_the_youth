Translation of Nordahl Grieg's Til Ungdommen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Til_Ungdommen)

Enemies on all sides, go
now live your life!
Into a storm of blood —
committed to strife!

Maybe you ask in fear,
with no shame, open:
what shall I fight with,
where is my weapon?

This, your shield from pain,
here is your sword:
love of humanity,
more than a word.

For all our future's sake,
seek it and tend it,
die if you must — but:
grow it, defend it!

Silent, go the grenades'
cold pirouette.
Stop their race to death,
with your spirit!

War is contempt for life;
creation is peace.
Throw your energies in:
Death, now to cease.

Love — and increase with dream —
all great that was!
Go into the unknown,
sieze the answers.

The unbuilt powerplants,
and stars unknown  —
form them with cherished life's
great minds reknowned!

Noble humanity,
rich is our Earth!
Where there is need and want,
neglect its cause.

Crush it in the name of life,
make injustice fall.
Sunshine, bread and spirit
are owned by all.

Now fall all the weapons
powerless down!
Where we make dignity,
our peace is found.

The one, on their right arm
bearing a burden,
priceless, irreplaceable
cannot murder.

This is our promise now,
to each other:
we will be good to
the earth, our mother.

We will take care of it,
the beauty and warmth –
as we would nurture
infants on our arm!
